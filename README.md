# JSON5 Language Support for Zed

Adds [JSON5](https://json5.org/) syntax highlighting to the [Zed](https://zed.dev) code editor.

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for all JSON5 features
- Supports comments, trailing commas, single-quoted strings, unquoted keys, and more
- Automatically activated for `.json5` files

## Credits

This extension uses the [tree-sitter-json5](https://github.com/Joakker/tree-sitter-json5) grammar by [@Joakker](https://github.com/Joakker).  
All grammar-level credit goes to the original author â€” this project only integrates it into Zed.
